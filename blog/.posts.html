<h3>Demythologized Prayer</h3>
</a>
<p>ADORNO Adorno adorno. He hated Jazz.
Must've never heard Coltrane. When I try to hear Coltrane
in my head I think of Flamenco Sketches, how he
nailed it on the first try. Spontaneity in music.</p>

<p>The Germans stopped talking about that when they
stopped improvising Cadenzas. Or when Schoenberg
spurned the performers.</p>

<p>I never called myself a performer and so playing
Jazz was out of the question. Which was fine because
I had the Germans on my side. What about Coltrane?</p>

<p>I've hardly written anything since Ken Ueno's class.
How the fuck am I supposed to respond to Berio? Ligeti?
Form. We killed God. Then we killed harmony and melody and
rhythm and we left ourselves with form. The resonance of an
empty box. Reich, pendulum music, the form is obvious.
But Coltrane, man. He doesn't seem to care.</p>

<p>The closest I ever felt to God was listening to
Milnes conduct the Ninth while I was on Acid.
First two movements watching the form evolve like a
Physics lecture or something. Third movement - sleepy.
Fourth movement - Brain turned off. No logic. Sound sound sound
Friendship, Fraternity, Freuden. Words. But that vibe.
Man, the connection. I remember the waves. Quantum
Mechanics like we're all entangled.</p>

<p>At this point I realized that music is the closest
thing to God that I've got. Coltrane, man, he gets it.</p>

<p>Impressions hits me like a fireball. First the punch.
Then the sting. The burn. By the time it hits my soul
I forget that I want it to make sense.</p>

<p>When I first started to listen to Jazz
it was because I couldn't understand it.
After Pereira and Taruskin, pop music doesn't cut it.
There's always Radiohead but then there was Jazz.
I picked up a Thelonius Monk cassette in the Village the
last time I was in the City and played it so much
I broke it. Trane was on that tape but he was so
young they hardly mentioned him. But those keys.
Monk and Blakey playing polyrhythms on Epistrophy.
I'll never forget. Bop was a mystery. I started to think
I should do this. But Myra didn't like my keys so I
never got lessons. But then, Db  Eb  Eb   Db  some  F# shit
on the bridge and the mystery --- well it's not in
the form. Even though I know the changes on Sketches and
Orland had me transcribe that solo, I'll never
figure it out. Not in words. Not like this.</p>

<p>I study music because of what I'll never understand.
Things like that vibe I felt after Einstein
On the Beach feeling like a cloud of dust or a
wave of air or anything but real. Some secret. Beyond
whatever Cog Sci bullshit. That touch. Whatever
it is to Transcend.</p>

<p>Transcendence. What a stupid word. About as stupid as
every other word. Adorno says to read language is to
understand language but to read music is to perform it.
Transcend. Transcend. I hear it like a sound. But
there's an idea hidden there. Louis Armstrong cuts a
solo into a 78 and the band sucks and it's
hot as hell in Chicago even though it's 8am. We listen
to it anyway because there's a gem there - Transcend.</p>

<p>God is dead, right? We killed him. Now we're stuck alone
in the universe with just our shitty selves. To transcend is
to escape. Escape into a dimension no physicist
ever heard of. Something Art can do. Something
Love can do. Art, Love, more words.</p>

<p>Art and Love are things we do that transcend what it is
to be remembered. Love is in the moment because you know
one day she's going to die but it doesn't matter. And
Art. Man, how many solos do you think Trane played that
never got recorded? Monk? It's that moment, man. Transcendence
happens in the moment. Now that's something you can't sell and
nobody can pay you for it anyway.</p>

<p>The other day I called my mom because I couldn't
figure out the meaning of it all. I call her just to
hear her voice. There are words but I can't remember.
I call her and hear the sound - maybe it's somewhere in
between Adorno's signifying and musical language -
and I get it. Everything's alright. Love, man. She never
says the words "I love you" but it's obvious anyway, hidden
in some structure of her voice. Love is the reason.</p>

<p>Love, Transcendence, Art. It's all the same thing.
Coltrane figured it out. It's what you catch fifteen
minutes into some breathless cigarette breathless solo
long after you stopped counting the bars.</p>

<p>When I jam, by myself, so loud then so quiet even
though there's no other noise around. When I manage to
forget the harmony and there ain't much difference between
white keys and black keys and nobody's listening and there are
no mistakes  because nobody's listening and it stops being
about right or wrong or good or bad just   burn   burn   burn
I'm praying for my mom. And there are no words. Nothing
is going to change. Nobody will remember these sounds.
That's okay. It's in the moment. Music, Love.</p>

<p>That's the reason. That is the prayer.</p>

<h3>First Post</h3>

<p>Cleaned up twitter.
Experimenting with keeping a plaintext blog.
Constructing an internet identity is complicated, there are a lot of decisions to be made, I feel like this is definitely a unique problem to "our", the new, post-internet generation.</p>
