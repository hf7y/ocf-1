Rusty Sharee
============
	
	The hallway fluoresced
	along its whole sterile length.
	I could hear a distant steely buzz
	
	Sharee's shoes tapping tile
	as we filed along this
	bureaucratic afterthought.
	
	There was jazz in this basement
	college boys at their best
	classmate Joe Escobar on at ten.
	
	Not that we cared.
	We wore whiskey on our breath	
	we made sure we were late.
	
	As that buzz grew warmer
	I became cool blue
	dancing all the moves
	I learned in the book.
	
	Music school means you can
	count the bars and get
	awfully mad when the
	sax misses the changes
	
	& knowing the heroes
	from Louis to J.C...
	You've probably 
	been to Harlem once.
	
	Joe wasn't so bad as he
	tried to translate that
	obsidian sound
	
	He knows those ivories like his
	own pale fingers and he
	speaks that ebony language
	like a native boy.
	
	If that sax would have 
	soloed along with the
	changes, I'd have clapped
	when I knew that I should
	
	Just like white Joe
	I've studied the classics
	and learned how to
	make them my own.
	
	And if anyone's jazzy
	it's rad Sharee. They're
	rusty brown and mean.
	
	But that space didn't
	have no room for my friend
	
	Those phosphorescent
	bodies were packed up to the
	door in a coolly lit
	worship of style.
	
	Whose Jazz sounds here? Is it mine,
	brought out of the books, bought
	with my college degree?
	
	Do I know the whole story?
	Know all the rules?
	
	Those kids didn't even
	know when to clap but they still
	lined up to take communion.
	They didn't even ask.
	
	But that Jazz wasn't Sharee's
	that's for sure
	they didn't play for her kind
	
	She melted into the wall
	small shadow, piece of night.
	We left early to beat the crowd.
	
	Afterwards, when we
	sat by the creek
	on a wooden bench
	softened by night
	
	she confided: "we 
	were the brownest
	people in the room"
	
	I thought: "me?
	I'm flattered to
	be on your team"
