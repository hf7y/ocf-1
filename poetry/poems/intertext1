Letter to Mariah I
==================

	Alice's room. Loft and
	bellow of smoke and
	sound. Woven density
	
	weightlessness of each
	ashen fiber crossing
	musical line clothes
	
	us in eachother. We
	enter and for a moment
	our souls are stitched
	
	together, rhythm and
	breathing,  we have
	become one organism
	
	As our sprits respire
	make that grey dance
	around us and ask us
	
	if we really know where
	the body stops and
	the world begins
	
	But against all of that
	something so humble,
	grounded with no
	aspirations to that
	kind of knowing: a rug
	
	Born as some modest
	brown its true color
	comes from its worn
		years
	
	patiently waiting
	as our lofted selves
	return to meet the
		earth
	
	catching the smells of
	ourselves, particles
	woven into its piles
	
	the rug is just a body
	essence is the lived life
	
	the honest stitching of
	each new love into the heart.
	
----------------------------
	
	The smoke whirling in your pipe
	is a text that travels through you
	
	and as we hum and pass
	piece and tangle our mass
	about the center of Alice's room
	
	I'm taken to the fine line
	pencil tipping
	the smouldering incense stick
	
	It rises, ash clean
	marks the air above
	emberheart	delicate dust
	
	but at a height, it
			    breaks
	turbulance pulls everyway and
	our clean thin charcoal stroke
	yields to the infinite
	
	smothering air, everdancing
	
------------------------------
		
	The charcoal stain of that
	first smoke is the
	boldness of Name
	
	certainty as we speak and
	place    each    word
	as the pencil takes the page
	
	but behind each curve and
	line lies an empty magic
	concealed, blotted over
	
	As the smoke rises and is
	washed away
	Name is lost
	
	scattered to a wind the
	idea is formless
	
	from Formlessness every
	Name was born.
	
	Pulling from all space
	drawn from air's ritual
		dance
	
	a Name is chosen as each
	scent of ash returns
	turbid cloud collects
	density, darkness
	
	the charcoal stain of that
	first smoke is a
	stroke on a page
