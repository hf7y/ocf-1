Honeyed Leaves
==============

	he plays with words
	he sins

	he plays with smoke

	
	she loves me
	I love her not



	trees have meant
	everything about love
	since that day with the
	blossoms took us a picture
	        &fixed our hearts

	the color of May
	the tree's white blood
	each   blossom   drip
	the grieving that is love
	
	each one
	a letting go
	a taking part
	
	
	& poetry
	the cameraman's trick
