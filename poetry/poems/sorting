The Season Now for Sorting
==========================

	 I ran away from Berkeley
	for the first time in four
	years, to see the seasons
	slip.

	      The solstice sunk in
	Washington. The district's stately
	marble brazen, blind beneath
	the highest sun, turned hearthstone
	wombwarmth of the stillest
	night.

	     The easy slip of hours
	with the cheapest beer. Turned
	moon turned moon to harvest
	moon; us cradled in the
	truckbed hiding bottles from
	the ire of Waleed's pious
	father.

	   Autumn now in Paris &
	the first chimney coughs
	The first night in Ba Tre's
	apartment: finally alone. I
	let the windowwings fly
	in and leave the shutters wide.

	I bow my breast over the rail
	to keep the cigarette smoke out &
	count the windows of the
	building across Rue Legendre.

	   The glitter of the spitoon
	street, its monochrome tobacco
	lanterns drag me back to 
	Berkeley and that starless
	sky: the first fuck I cared not
	call love.

	    Nicole & her Newport
	lips daring me to drink
	party, noise & sex & shame
	Her menthol kiss and vomit
	Berkeley and her endless
	Fall, every evening mist
	The slimmest bed
	scratchpaper walls
	How with her frame fixed
	in my fold, I felt still
	but sole

	     
             I ran away from Berkeley
	   to let the leaves break loose.

	        Autumn now in Paris
	The trees unstitch their signatures

	   The season now for sorting &
	     discerning what to keep
