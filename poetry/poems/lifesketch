life sketch
============

	Some softness
	warm essence
	taste    and the
	rasp rustling of your
	cotton thigh upon my
       		ear
	
		we met as
	strangers in
	California night
	crisp air
	still smoke
		we danced
	
	earlier I sold you
	San Francisco misty
	glow and placid
	Berkeley air
	
	I wore music like
	my second skin
	hoping to seep past
	some topographic
	truth of your image
	
	But now I wait
	tepid    careful
	geometry of your
	body
	
	studying your
	silhouette
	relief in
	orange
	lampglow
	
		for a
	sign you will
	speak with
	moistmouth and the
	curve of your
	back
	
	Your fingers
	words within my
	hair
	
	
	I will watch as
	bluenight and
	windowbreeze
	spin earth
	
		as you
	tell me your
	story    then
	disappear
	beyond the
	mountains
