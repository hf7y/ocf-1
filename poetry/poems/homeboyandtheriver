Homeboy and the River
=====================	
			
	Ash sky
	wet glass
	rain
	spectacled face
	sits at the
	window on a
	cappucino
	
	grey faces
	pass
	count off
				
		I could do without
	
	one two
	
	weather
	awaker
	
	colors in
	boots
	deep runs
	water around
	
	a girl in the street
	stands in a puddle	
	
	winds
	stronger storm
	crystal sheen
	slate street
	silent
