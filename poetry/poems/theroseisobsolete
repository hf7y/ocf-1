Excerpt from Spring and All
===========================

	The rose is obsolete
	but each petal ends in
	an edge, the double facet
	cementing the grooved
	columns of air --- The edge
	cuts without cutting
	meets --- nothing --- renews
	itself in metal or porcelain ---

	whither ? It ends ---

	But if it ends
	the start is begun
	so that to engage roses
	becomes a geometry ---

	Sharper, neater, more cutting
	figured in majolica
	the broken plate
	glazed with a rose

	Somewhere the senses
	makes copper roses
	steel roses ---

	The rose carried weight of love
	but love is at an end --- of roses

	If it is at the edge of the
	petal that love waits

	Crisp, worked to defeat
	laboredness --- fragile
	plucked, moist, half-raised
	cold, precise, touching

	What

	The place between the petal's
	edge and the

	From the petal's edge a line starts
	that being of steel
	infinitely fine, infinitely
	rigid penetrates
	the Milky Way
	without contact --- lifiting
	from it neither hanging
	nor pushing ---

	The fragility of the flower
	unbruised
	penetrates spaces
