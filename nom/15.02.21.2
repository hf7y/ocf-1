Why do we study music?
Why do we write about music?
	  write music?

I study Beethoven,
I read the analysis of his counterpoint &

I am jolted.
I race home from the cafe
taking a detour through moes
to pick up some manuscript paper &
Then hit my house to work out voices

Part writing, voice leading
So abstract, so of the mind
but it does move me
if only as a nerd

I don't write about Beethoven
to bring out some truth into the world
this is not my science
what use?

I engage with this text
the canon,
the scholarship,
for my own selfish satisfaction, but

to do it,
to be in this world,
I need others who have come here
made games here
I mimick their
dance
they
teach me to move on this earth &

when I write, for
myself and others
it is to keep record

to wear the path
make it easier
to move

Does â€Žit go beyond?
I don't have a problem
with what Rumph writes
I rather enjoy it, actually.

He puts on, however,
that air of truthmaking
   he plays the detective
It's all rather unecessary.

===========================

I do have designs
for the whole thing.
I want to change people
move them, perhaps
into being
like me

Or, it's not all that
maybe, too, I seek
the validation,
the company

When Natalia, diligent
Natalia reads me
she'll point to
something, say
that's me!
Hey!

We resound,
move each other
make real, each other
bring into being each other
as against, in between,
I am a little
less alone
