A quaint and hilarious break into chess.com.
Something so delightful about games with Tony.
I think I will leave my earlier rantings &
Try to come to this with a fresher approach.
To be in such an emotional hold is to be held.

Pronomina: let me look at what there is &
Holy fuck there was a lot. I can't even begin to know.
I left southern california very suddenly the last time I came to visit my family.
Bac Binh was there when I left, but Ba and Bac Hien were asleep.
I left them a note.
It said: "Ciao Ba, Ciao Hien, Em de hoc."
Maybe it is kind of cute how badly I fucked up.
Just now reading wikipedia on Vietnamese pronouns, I should have called myself con not em.
Em is between siblings, what I would call myself to my brother.

The other day I went to visit co Minh-ha in her office.
I am strangely forward in how I interact with people like that.
I feel very much like Prince Myshkin in these moments.
So I came and we talked.
It was so fun to see in what ways we relate.
After some kind of theorizing or small talking, I asked her to ask me questions!
Brazen perhaps but I felt it was the most honest thing I could do.
At first she asked me about my name,
I had been very intentional about writing my full name everywhere: Zachary Viet Pine.
I wanted her to know that we had this connection, that it was even why I chose to take the class.
What did she say: "does your name say something; half-half?" &
It didn't offend me at all; I wanted her to know!
We talked about our families; we both come from the north.
There was a migration to the south. 

I asked her about her music; or did she ask me what I studied?
We talked about that for a while, that she studied composition, then ethno.
She said she always accepts music majors into her classes.

Then she asked me how I heard about the class.
It was so fun to say this to her!
I was coy about it; Steven says I am good at being coy.
"I took this class in the architecture department.
It's a photography class.
We took these weekly photos.
It was taught by a guy named Jean-Paul." &
That smile on her face when I said it. 
Hehe I can't help but recall that moment fondly.
She said she would remember me to him.
I hope they talk about me.

Before I left, the last question I had to ask her; it was the question I came to ask.
"How should I call you?"
I suppose I could have looked it up.
I would have avoided the mistake of first asking if I should use Bac &
She said "co, co Minh-ha."
How great! what a connection.
It means so much to me now.
Even, can I say, her work feels like it is mine!
Her success feels like it is mine!
We share a world, our own special world &
Whatever I could come to achieve would be for her too, would be hers.
This inter/space, this world we make for ourselves, between each other.
Maybe it is the every day for her, so common place.
But for me, Zachary, it is so unique.
She is the only one, the only person not in my family I have this with.
Even my own mother is not "me" but "mom".

In thinking about Pronomina, I was reflecting on Ba.
There is this looming task, that at the end of this semester I will have to write about "Late Beethoven."
Lateness, oh dear; what is lateness to me?
My life is so new, so fresh.
But everytime I visit Ba I am confronted with Lateness; there is a coming to an end.
Am I terrible for saying to? thinking so?
I sit there with no words to say and holding her hand &
All I can think of is how much I must cherish this moment.
There is a speciality to every second, a rarity.
Maybe it is a sin to write that into Beethoven, but why not?
Beethoven is mine! and I can do with it what I want.
If it gives me something, some meaning to read it this way, than fuck all who say I can't.

Lateness has coded in it this imminent loss, this inevitable coming to an end.
Must the Will to Motion always give way to the Will to Conclusion?

Perhaps there is a way in which beginning and ending are always linked.
I am quite happy resting in paradoxes in this way.

I look to Ba as this spirit of the language.

I point to a way in which language is of the body.
There is some way in which my words are an act of physicality.
When I speak co Minh-ha's name, there is some force of...
	I have to pull the sounds out
	I have to inflect each word with a pitch
	I become a singing instrument
     &  It is my physicality that resonates
	      my shape
My body is moved into being, moved in its being.
In that ghost of Vietnamese that lives within me, what am I?
It lives as these shapes, these distant memories, dreams.
I hold them in my form, not as words, knowings..
I do not know this world, Vietnamese.
I inhabit it, though.

---

How do I feel about the lateness in Ba's years?
I can see in her form something.
Do I think she is ready? Ready?
There is something in lateness about readiness, preparedness.
It is a preparedness for nothing, for the absense of something.
There is an imminence for the coming absence. 

So what is it I feel I will be losing, offering up.
Oh dear Ba, she holds the family together.
Her name possesses us all. 
It holds us across generations.

The only name given by all generations.
She holds a pronominal centrality.
My brother and my cousins are mine by virtue of Ba; that we all call her Ba.
My mother and her siblings likewise, Me.

Our togetherness is owned in her &
It is true, owned in the memory of her.
So we see something that lives beyond the body.
The pronominal as an extension of the Prenominal.
I don't even know her name!!
She is but Ba to me, and even to my father! who knows her through me; he gives her name through me.
Merely her name, that name I don't know, does not work to hold together.
It does not connect me to my cousins, even my father.
But her proname, that kinship strength.
It represents a being &
what is that being in lateness?

Lateness is in a way a condition of the body.
It is worn in the body.
But the proname is not of the body.
The proname is between bodies.

Lateness is given through the proname; it is transported to me.
This transport is by virtue of the proname.
When I see oldness around me, it is static.
The old man on the street (appelled) is static for me.
He is old always as I know him.
He is not late for there is only an imagined early, or maybe I don't even imagine it.
If I am careless, he is all he is now.
Those cafe med regulars, static tableau.
They are merely prenames to me, the float, Johns.

But Ba was always Ba, even before I came into her world.
Her name pro/ceeded me. 
Ba because she made me.

<<33<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

In lateness is there a coming to the proname? a returning?
Does lateness make the proname meaningful?
What of those eternal beings?
Take me to the mythic gods of greece or even the many names of Allah.
Are these pronominal relationships?
I think of the grey-eyed Athena.
How many other names did she have?
She was not in a pronominal relationship with any mortal.
There was no proname for her, because such a relationship is bidirectional (not necessarily bijective).
Occasionally a hero, Odysseus perhaps, would come into naming &
He would thus be the subject of heroic stories in that very naming.
Odysseus: a prenominal character.

When I play with these creatures, they are so malleable.
I can tell any stories about them I wish.
Mythos is such a plastic world, it can move.
Any bard so adept can change the course of the tale, write the new mythology.
I can make these characters my own.

Who was that playwrite who found a trick to save Helen's virtue?
They did it with Mary.
Write into the world a story otherwise impossible.
There certainly is a power to these prenominal stories.
Maybe they are of all stories; all stories are of this kind.

What stories are there of Ba?
All I can remember, Ong was in prison, political prison.
I don't know if it was the French.
I think it was some Vietnamese political party.
Five years he was in prison &
Ba, did she have children?
    Those first two boys?
She was forced to live in a shack? or
Some small structure on the property.
Treated like a dog did mom say?
Poorly taken care of I'm sure.
I don't think she ever forgave that family for that, Ong's family.
Maybe she did not have to.
Mom's grandmother; she did have two but I only know one.
It must have been Ong's mother right?
That was the woman! &
Poor Ba had to live with her.
Mom said her grandmother and her would fan each other. or
Maybe just mom fanned her.
That is the only image I see.

How strange that mom's memories have come to me.
Do we do this? put our memories into each other.
Remembering things together like this.

These are not epic stories, tall tales.
They are simple records to families, of being together.
They are not morally directed.
They do not build into the world an ethics. Or
At least not such a platitudinal one.
It is an ethics of the each other.
The Odyssey is a story of hospitality.
It writes into the world the divine code between kings. but
These stories, they write me into the world.
Where Ba is placed, I am too.
There is that way in which we are one, Ba and I &
It is no bijective because they too place my brother into the world.
My cousins and I come to visit this distant land in the North.
I don't think even my mother has ever been there. But
She is there in these stories of Ba.

The mythic story, the prenominal story places the man.
They make the man in his world: some guy, Odie.
These kinship stories, these pronominal stories, they place me!
I come into the world, because we are one, Ba and I: one family.

In her lateness, Ba's names separate out.
Her prename moves into this world of tales, of fictions.
They would become stories for the news paper, biographies.
If only Ba was so heroic.
(	I envy those people who copy the stories of their families.
	They elevate these humble folk to the heroes of the wine dark sea.	
	Ba and I speak no common language.
	This task is not one I can do.
	Instead I will remember Ba on the same day everyone else remembers Ba.
	We will burn the same incense at the same temple.			)
Her prename can be found in the census section of the library.
(	I think it's in that hallway right when you enter Main Stacks from Moffitt.
	Oh the filthy things that library has seen me do!			)
If new stories are invented, they will be added on, as history.
They will be new clothes for a corpse.
They will be jesus made up on the cross for the cameras.
But her proname, it will live.
It will live in me, at least as long as I live.
It does not leave this world, it remains.
But without the body, without the material, where does it live?
Not even in these books, these census books.
There they do not write Ba.
Her proname lives on in me, us, the bearers of that.
Those stories are merely testaments to her name.
Odysseus is his Odyssey.
Those stories merely point to Ba.
I point to Ba.
