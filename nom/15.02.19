I just met with Bogart this morning.
I ran attrociously late. Perhaps,
because I stayed up so late last night
writing another one of these.

Maybe I do not need beer to write
like this, but what can I say?
I've just drank coffee now.
One drug for another.

Sitting in the OCF here.
I was hoping to see
her at the desk.
I think it's fair;
She herself even told me
what time and where to find her &

It's good anyway, to come here.
Ascetic in a way,
though still on the computer,
the publicity
keeps me focused lest embarrased.

I pulled up this weeks reading
on our dear friend Ludvig.
Some guy, a lesser Beethoven,
Rumph, is writing about the
contrapunctal style that
emerged in the "Late" period.

There is a play, Rumph makes,
between the 'dynamics of
sonata form' and the 
counterpoint.

I am drawn to make metaphors
(oh Nick, just beat me if
you think this is a sin)

The dynamism of the sonata:
it is didactic, proscriptive
(what do those words mean)
it reminds me of the
enlightenment effort to
control the world
wield it with
the mind.

Sonata form is rhetorical,
argumentative, sophistic/ated.
It places its terms forward
and then proceeds to
"work them out"
It is teleological, true, but
I believe counterpoint so is.
It's telos is one of force,
control, powerful conclusion.
It is coercive;
it's morality
imposes.
We are not free to
interpret the conclusion
make truth for ourselves.

Let me call this the
analytic style, put it
against counterpoint
as this very scientific
approact to truthmaking.

Counterpoint: I take it to be
a much more open, flexible
form of truth production.
Rumph likens it to the church:
sure. It is a text that is open.

Maybe Beethoven is himself
the diviner, then. He has
special access to the heavens.

Counterpoint is Baroque
it has this ornamental quality;
it inspires awe;
it lends itself
to interpretation as deified.

The way in which Sonata-form
is so didactical, so clear,
it is popular, charitable:
Democratic
It plays into a kind of
meritocratic liberal utopia.

Sure, sure, it was in the courts &
then the crusty salons but
what was democracy to these people
anyway? If Schiller loves Athens
it is not a love for the slaves.

Counterpoint moves away from this
democracy into an autocracy
monarchy.

We have Beethoven with
the divine right to rule.
He is our infallible pope (&
you see it in those 1930s
hermenutics of him.
if ever a god lived!)

Maybe we can call counterpoint
a kind of monopolization of
truth. I suppose, one can,
through grueling effort,
analyze, pull apart the
tune, but
to what
effect?
Then, then
one has to be
literate; such a task
is for the page & so on that
page we still have a monopoly or
oligarchy of interpreters, those with
the right to interpret truth, make it.

Can I so say that Sonata Form isn't like this?
Well, there is, within it, that one right answer.
It is the kind of thing "anyone" can access with
enough attention if the themes are clear enough.

Looking merely at the audible effect, well...
I have to listen to these late quartets and
sonatas to get the effect of the fugues but
I suspect that I cannot access their forms
in quite the same way.

-----------00000000000000000000-------------------

I will as I move forward,
try and build this
contrast between
sonata form &
counterpoint
I will try and
develop stylistically
a literal example (metaphor) of
the one and then the other so as to
come to be able to see them, as I
understand them, on the page.
I will draw on those
themes of the
monopoly on
knowledge and
supposedly democratic
knowledge (of which I am quite keptical)

Perhaps I will be able to imagine these
two worlds Beethoven was inhabiting.

I am quite interested to see how a
contrapunctal style of writing looks
When I imagined it before, I do think
I believed it to be impossible, not a
task that language could accomplish.

But there must be some ways in which I do it,
weave themes in and out of each other, much
differently than if I exposed each one at a time.

So there. So there.
I'm sorry reader,
this was quite
didactic, dry,
probably not fun
for anybody here. But
if you made it this far
I thank you dearly.
