Just back from shopping with my dad.
We bought a table set from Ikea.
I was so embarrased to have bought it: $150. 
What for? embarrassed that my father will spend money to take care of me?
It's a delicate place, not to be ungrateful &
I definitely am taken care of.
Perhaps it is the way in which these small interchangable gifts,
these industrial gifts, produced on a mass scale,
become all that there is to be greatful for.

I told him I was seeing a therapist.
He reacted about as I would expect,
somewhat bewildered, I suppose,
that I cannot share with him.
It's a funny thing; when I went into Bogart's office,
I told him I was there to talk about sex, or
first I told him that I usually speak to my mother
about most of my concerns in life, but that
I have come to be unable to talk to her about sex.
Bogart, a white guy basically interchangable with dad,
said that was normal, it was not something that
most of us talk to our mothers about.

It really comes down to architecture.
In my house there are more bedrooms than there ever were people.
I have some distant memory of me, young,
coming up to my parents locked bedroom door.
I wasn't sure what was going on.
Was I distraught? confused?
I sometimes look back on that moment &
blame myself for my parents failed marriage, that
I was getting in the way, coming between.
Was it a failure really?
Is the only success to wait until one of you dies before the other?
How is that winning?
I would say that I turned out quite alright.
Am I the result of their successful partnership?
a success of their partnership?
I do succeed their partnership.

I am pulled away from my dad.
I don't trust him to know Family.
What is this skepticism?
I think I place within him all that I find in myself,
all that I distrust in myself regarding love and inter/.

----the beer already came; the cigarette now----

His father and his marriages, both ended in divorce.
I see marriage as absurd; it is this fantasy, that
I might ever be married.
I don't believe in forever like that.

I recently ended things with Natalia;
just another thing I never told my dad.
He never knew to begin with actually.
Why? It was so good, so perfect.
Was I scared? was I unwilling to commit.
I look at Spencer, so able to give himself.
He is such an available lover. 
Even I love him; I am not scared to love him.

That perfection I had with Natalia,
it pointed toward some infinity,
some terrifying infinity.

Ryan sent me an excerpt;
(Natalia pronounces "excert"
I can't really blame her;
receipt, receet, recipie)
David foster wallace:
He writes of the "we";
this holy union of the "I"+"You" &
this character, afraid,
unable to give himself up.

That word "pronounce:"
pronoun, pronounce.
Maybe there is something,
a sonic element.
That the pronominal is a condition of sound.
Sound is this fleeting pointer,
it decays, diffuses,
collides with what is around it &
In that collision it is annihilated.
Sound must be produced, spoken;
It must be brought to fore.
There is something missing
when I write "Ba" and not "Bà".
Her name, its meaning, comes from who said it.
The speaker, the speaking,
sound gives the meaning.
Pronounciation is so important.
"Ba" could mean father;
It could mean three.
All about the tones,
the pronounciation,
this is the pronominal.

Maybe there is a falsity when
I am unwilling to say to Natalia
"I love you".
I tell myself, I tell her, that
I feel it; it is in me;
you needn't hear it;
just know.
But the pronouncement,
the coming into the world that sound is,
it transforms, it moves the universe.
It is the very sounds I make,
not the words, not the signification, but
those vibrations in the air.
The pronominal lives in those vibrations,
so delicate, so very there, but
so fleeting and fragile.

Bà lives, not in me, but
outside of me, in these sounds.
It is when I speak her name,
really try to get it right,
that she comes alive for me.

Beethoven can live dead on a page,
ink, stain, corpse of letters.
His existence does not rely on me. But
In a paradox, though, it does,
In that way he is a musician.
He needs others, he needs that sound.
Music, our performative music,
needs the pronouncement.
I imagine that lonely deaf oaf,
writing his beautiful quartets,
but unable to put them into the world,
not in any other way but his ink.
Was it a kind of premature death?
a death of something before the body,
the corpse, the mind still moving,
but something gone.
