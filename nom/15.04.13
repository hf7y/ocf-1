writing about co's work
tony said yesterday
something about composition
what is expected of
a robust work, is structure.

In a large sense,
I really am meditating
here. It's not
as if I've had theses
thoughts already.

I will focus on what
enables that movie
we saw last time
to 'give me voice'
but not speak for me

I will discuss the
challenges of this,
the inevitable pull
toward the exotic,
for example

Finally, I will think
about my own work. I
will consider these
challenges as I confront
my project to make music
in (for, by) the suburbs

So first, this film
& how does it play
for me?

What is it that
lets me say, "it
gives me voice"?

Can it be a way it
listens ahead of me?
that there is a listener
anticipating my hearing,
taking care.

The attention to listening
let me become a listener,
it allowed me to listen
as myself. In that a
discovery of "myself"
a necessary uncovering
or becoming.

In that moment of listening
I am allowed to come into
being.



Necessarily, I must feel
as if I am centered. For
it to be mine I must feel,
not necessarily that I was
the imagined center of the
work, but that I may be
myself-as-center.

It is important that
I do not feel that I must
transform, shift into the
shape of some other viewer.
If I were not able to take
the film as myself, then
It could not be matter
for becoming.


So to the next point
in keeping with my structure.

My being-through-the-film
is only made possible by
a series of subversions,
decenterings, questionings
of the center.

Primarily I can focus on
the multiplicity of languages
that denies a single all-knowing
viewer position.

I am not forced to be jealous of
one viewer who knows it all.
That those who can understand
the Vietnamese, distinguish the
different dialects, they lack
that element of not-knowing.

I feel as if my not-knowing
as diaspora is not imagined,
anticipated in the films
production, as a place of
decay (of knowledge, of centering)
but is seen as another valid
position (not center, not off center)

When co in her interviews talks about
hearing as the Vietnamese in exile
as part of making the film, I am
allowed to trust in my experience.
I can read the specificities of
myself in the process of understanding,
coming to understand.





I make the claim, then,
that all of the politics
of interviews, they come to
this. They come to this point
in which I am let in. I am let
in wholly, or what feels more
complete than ever before.

Consequently, the archetypal
interview is one of closing,
bounding, of keeping out.
It imagines a world of only
two speakers and two listeners.
I am made a voyeur as I read,
or rather, I am an incomplete,
disempowered version of the
authors who read first.

The text is dead when
I come to it.

So lastly, as for my own work.

I will soon make the album
in the suburbs. I will join
with my increasingly talented
fellows. They've had nothing to
do but make this music, pump the
iron. In a way, I am nervous, to
meet them, to take them on, to do
them justice.

My question: how can I leave room
for them? How can I make this work
open to their experience? even further,
how can I open this work up to more
experiences? 

Co's work tells me: decenter, question
the center even in its absence.
So I must imagine the center,
and I cannot merely kill it,
It will remain as its corpse.
To move it, or to dance
with it, play, move
it around. Yes,
to open it up
to many.
