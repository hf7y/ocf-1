Eating alone again.
It is so damn delicious.
Its tofu and spaghetti, pretty strange.
Tomatoes, garlic, ginger;
How have I gotten so damn good?
But that thing missing;
there's no body here to testify
except for me.

These lonely jazz tunes,
sailing voices, sliding
all over the place,
searching; I let them
fill my space up.

I leave the door open
hoping someone will
save me, break this
bubble that I'm in.

Ran into Rosella after class today.
It was the first Nile Project day;
perhaps I was too critical in class.
I wasn't the only one disappointed.

Delightful: she was in Rodrigo's
class with Juliette, last semester.
I came in for the final presentations
to play the guitar for Rodrigo,
have his back. But then
something beautiful.
In that extra time after class,
the margin, hanging, vulnerable
to being clipped off, pruned,
we came together to write a song.
I played the coach in that way
I've learned to do. 
Did she say it was the
best discussion section ever?
What an honor there!
It's these little testamonies that
allow me to believe in myself.
I can't take a paycheck, or at least
I haven't been looking for one;
Can't look to that;
Can't look to grants.
I live in those little moments of
assurance, gratitude.
This is just another way that
I <em>am</em> in between.
Something of me lives in the inter/stice.

I showed Rosella what I wrote about Bà
from a few days ago &
She really got it;
she was really appreciative that
I could share like that.
Oh what a paradox, that
Writing from such a vulnerable place...
It is the only way I have access at all.
It is the only reason I have anything to say.
Yes, yes, it is hard. But
It is also very easy.
It was hard to come to let go.
It is an act of listening to ones self.
For some, perhaps, it is the hardest thing to do, but
me, so arrogant, so brazen; of course I love myself.
Look at me. Here I am. But
In that moment, I had to show her me.
I had to give something.
It was a way to show that it can be done.
I will not speak to anyone's experience but
my own. But in it, someone (you all) may come
to meet me there, find that they move with these
words. I need an audience after all &
There is Rosella.
It was her gift to me! reading that.

How should I go about structuring this thought.
I put it pretty well on the roof of Kingman,
smoking a spliff with Haley. Lovely
She's always down to entertain my theories.

I take the surnominal
	   prenominal
	   pronominal to gesture towards
Different modes of being. Strangely,
There are rather literate modes of being.
Maybe not. Can I say, rather, that
the preeminent mode of communication
brings with it its dominant mode of being.
I'm thinking only that writing, the literate,
the page constructed Beethoven as such, as
surnominal object, name towards idea.
Bà's domestic world was taken over,
overshadowed, dominated.
What happened to me?
First I knew Vietnamese, that first
language of love, family, kinship &
It was lost, overrun by english, this
language in essence colonial, erasing &
Verbal english no less,
my mouth muscled into these few sounds,
these consonants; no diacritics needed.
As I came to write, as school became about
these words, this text, the language moved
into my hands, moved out of my heart, core &
Came to rest in my head, hands, eyes.
Beethoven, on the page? in the text.
The text that goes beyond any one ink;
The text that defeats its own manuscript.
Copyerrors, editions, revisions,
E flats in the double bass.

So I will play these three kinds of names
taking for each a champion:
Beethoven, Odysseus, Bà.
Of course they all fight alongside their
own small armies but they will lead.

Toward what?
Whither this theory of names
