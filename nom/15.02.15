I sit now in Tony's room to ponder my theoretical question. 
What was it again that I began to write; the pronominal, <em>on Pronomina</em>.
There is something about dignity going on, outside the theory itself, if there can ever be such a place.
There is some experience I seek to elevate, some part of me.

The last time I used that word, dignity, was in Nick Mathew's class.
Actually it was just now in Tony's room as we were talking about something.
We were talking about making a videogame, a videogame that put our worlds on display.
I contrasted <em>Dignity</em> with <em>the Exotic</em>.
We joked about a metatheory that might be necessary even before I can write what I want to write now.
Wouldn't that just be unfair though, if I had to do that?

So I said something about how I want to write from my experience, elevate my world to this level.
It is a Beethovinian (see: surnominal) level that I want to engage in &
Before you say something about being colonized and selling out or something, just allow it.
This is a hard world to navigate and these things of prestige are very complex.
I don't quite have a strong way to handle them now.

Just earlier even I was talking to Eileen.
We were talking about the future, a very late college thing to do &
I mentioned being a music teacher for young children and how I was put off by it.
For some reason, I can't help but feel that I am condecending to do this.
There is an immature relationship with <em>Dignity</em> hidden in there.

But about my theory: the Pronominal; I want to put my world on the dignified stage.
I want to make a space that I have priviledge access to, that makes me and people like me special.
This takes me back to Nick's class.
Why did I say it?
He said something so offensive, so politically incorrect that all of my friends scoff in its retelling.
I have repeated it so many times that I can't even quote it properly.
It was someting about the state of scholarship, on being a scholar &
He talked of how, as scholars, we reproduce the system of values of our institution.
He said it so plainly, as if it was of no consequence.
It was useless to say anything but I did anyway; in that room he is the despot &
That is where I used this word <em>Dignity</em>.
I said "there is something I need to assert, my dignity, in doing this scholarship."
That week we just read Schiller; what he says about women! can you believe it?
Did we discuss it in class? But tangentially.
What of the dignity of those women in that class?
Could they even have said anything if they wanted to under the reign of that despot?

For me it is not quite the same, but it is almost so.
I think of the japanese; one hundred thousand singing the 9th symphony.
What a bow to colonial power; sucking the bloody dick of the far west.
I hate it. I hate it. I hate it.
When I taught piano to that kid, that club I was in, saturated with these Engineers.
Good Asian kids on track to getting that good job.
They still practice the violin.
This club is just a resume padder.

If I write about Beethoven, try and make a contribution to 200 years of deification, where is my dignity?
How can I just assimilate into this theoretical practice?
How can I just take it?
But I can't leave it either, just go along my way, act like nothing is happening.
I need to burn the whole building down.
I need to do something irreverent, blasphemous.
I need to spit in the face of german idealist jesus.
After me, they will know who to answer to.
