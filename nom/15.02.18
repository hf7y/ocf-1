Unlikely to get much writing in.
Santi is going to call soon.

I hung out with Natalia tonight for
the first time since we decided not
to be involved with each other...
(like that)

It was hard.
It seemed harder on her than
on me.
I've got distractions: that
cute girl at the desk
outside of the OCF.

N read my writing at
Cafe Med.

We met up at Sather Gate and
walked there together.
I saw the old Ellesworth crew,
Steven, Grayson, and Ryan
sitting just by the door.
It was a looming anxiety but
I couldn't break it to Natalia
though she knew anyway.
(I would keep glancing over to
catch Steven online shopping.
Addicted that guy is.)

Looks like Santi discovered
his Swag, finally. 
It has so much to do with
fucking, that thing.

Something slight emerged in that
conversation: the inter.
He talked about this paragidm in
architecture - client first -
where the architect becomes the
most perfect craftsman for an idea.
Important, I think, in the way that
it is humbling. I sureley do not like
the superstar ("starchitect as
Penelope at the OCF called it")
way of treating space, projects, plans.

Yet, this client first approach still
reproduces much of the starchitect idea;
It is merely a concession, a ceeding of
power from the one party to the other.
It fails to really change the structure,
the architecture of the work.
Can you see? That what was claimed as a
rightful power of the architect before
is now given to the client, that
they are now asked to play this role.
Perhaps this does result in
difference, but that is
merely by accident, I think.

I can develop this thought better by
offering the alternative I gave Santi.
I'm taken to the concept of the
e·pis·to·lar·y
This is the metaphor I brought forth.
In writing the letter, who is at the center?
The sender, the addressee?
Of course it is neither, that
the letter lives in between.
This is the inter/.

So I take this metaphor into
the world of architecture &
actually I extract it further.
All of my writings, works,
take this form. I have assumed
the epistolary relationship.

Take this to be part of the Pronominal.
Perhaps not as my english pronouns
afford me to express (I, my, me
do not embed in them the relation to
the specific you), but
the Pronominal as I have woven it.

Let me remind you (my friendly readers,
Natalia are you there? Santi have you
finally come around to reading these?).
The way that pronouns work in Vietnamese
is my starting point: in this text and also
in my life, that is how I first learned to
know the world.
Pronouns are generally two directional.
In the way that I call Bà what I do,
I imply that she call me "con" &
take this out of the familial realm;
strangers I meet, grey women,
I call them, too, "Bà" &
so they call me "con".
This is the way in which the pronouncement
builds the relationship, puts it into the world.
That these expressions create an inbetween,
a space between. So when
I create this epistolary style,
I mean to say that my references to myself
understand you, they create you; that
my references to myself are only possible,
only capable of comprehension as you are,
as I imagine you to be.

So I look to this space of the inbetween, that
the center does not point to me or you, but
us together, and a specific us!

I suppose there are degrees of this,
there are the ways ‌in which I relate to those
distant readers, those far off professors
I plan to show this to in a few months,
those imagined readers, those that
I cannot now possibly imagine.

Back to Santi, the architect
(after I light this cigarette) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nihil criticized me before of
the way that I offer "advice"
to my friends; that theres is
an unsafeness, that
they too are not challenged to
criticize me &
this is true, that
I construct myself to be the
swagmaster, safe, infallible

I asked Natalia to give me
straight up criticism of my
previous entries into this &
I was quite worried.
Worried that it would impact my
style, that an increased consciousness
towards my technique would inhibit my work.
Maybe so. Why is it that I had to bust out this
stupid sierra nevada and this cigarette to
find the flow that allows me to write?

I did this again, when talking to Santi just now.
Last night, he found himself unable to
work on his project. He placed himself in
studio for, what?, nine hours? all for naugsht.
Diagnostic Zachary came to the rescue, that
I said it was the lack of stake, of real
rib-eye steak that was making his work impossible.
I did, to my credit, gesture to my own experience.
I have come to sit in this very style, this pensive,
self-centered, (inter/ centered?) style, and
be quite comfortable, feel quite safe, and free.

I find this way of relating to projects, of
placing them squarely in the inbetween
begets ease.

I look back to the days of Traveling Cadavers
(my highschool band, if you don't know) &
How very possible it was for me to write then.
I don't think I've ever been so prolific in my work.

This past semester was something close,
writing with Natalia and Rodrigo.
Some days it felt so impossibly easy,
unfair even.

There is a freedom that
comes from placeing works
between me and my friends.
If there is trouble,
I have a buddy who can save me.
We can rely on each other,
take care of each other.

I want to elevate this form of
thinking? being?
place it squarely in the front.
Even when I am working alone,
I am thinking of others, of
the inevitable other,
the unavoidable other.

I claim this for the Pronominal;
this is a fundamental characteristic.
In doing that, I suppose I am taking a stance;
I am advocating for the Pronomial as
a from of relating, understanding
one's self against the work.

Did I learn this from Ken (Ueno)(thày Ken)?
He does this thing in his composition classes;
He introduces us to the performers that
we are writing for. We know them!
We can ask them questions.
Telling, recently,
I went to a
performance,
"curated" by Ken.
Afterwards, Spencer &
I and Ken and the floutist,
all when to some bar in Soma. But
I think before then, after the show,
the guy opened up for questions &
I asked him, what is fun for you?
Was it so innocent a question?
People laughed at it.
There I go again,
Prince Myshkin.
I learned this
from Ken, this
way of relating,
a way of knowing,
coming to know those
around me, those in my
world. For me, as composer,
it really is the most fundamental of
questions. It is a very important factor that
guides what I want to write, what I choose to write into the world.
(If you want to know what he said: it was some delicate balance
between keeping things varied, hard, interesting,
worth the challenge, I suppose, was implied.)

------drum solo------

I'm losing it now, distracted, out of beer.
Next week I will have to present in Nick's class on
Beethoven, and counterpoint, and some guy's argument that
he is making a conservative gesture, that
counterpoint signifies the old, a kind of return to
the glorious christian rule over europe. 
What is he going to argue? that
by placing counterpoint against the classic symphonic forms,
Beethoven is imagining some utopic solution?
or maybe exploring some way of balancing
the old and the new?

Oh, I feel so disconnected from the task!
If only I could find a way to write myself into it.
I want to feel like it is mine.
