I’m coming home.
With the wind at my back, the chance of a lifetime
The cries in the dark, the whispers of Satan
None of it matters, not now, not when it’s clear, that
I’m coming home.

The friends that we left behind
The ones we knew would always be there
The ones we feared would always be there
For me, for you, for us, for granted
That they would have to scream at the sun.

Chorus:

	And all we could do was scream at the sun
	Sitting on our porches, sitting in our chairs
	Staring out from windows so near
	So far from where we belong
	Only to realize, that all we can do
	All we could do was scream at the sun

And then there was only one
Sitting on that porch from long ago
The ones where daddies and mommas row
While the autumn’s bite make it hard
Makes it hard to believe
Makes it hard to believe
That I’m still home.

That I’m still home
Here and now, staring at the boys
The boys who didn’t get out
Who didn’t see the ocean far away
Didn’t see the women from yonder
It’s just the stories
Because I’m still home.

They’re my friends, the ones I know
The ones I cherish because I believe
That to cleave from them could not be
Because I don’t want to be alone
Not when I’m home.
