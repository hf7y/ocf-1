<h1>I</h1> <h2>B</h2> <h4>[Bmaj]</h4>
<p>
cold December morning<br>
deep beneath the city<br>
electrocuted voice announcing:<br>
<em>capitol south: doors opening left side</em>
</p>
<h2>A</h2> <h3>a</h3> <h4>[Fmaj]</h4>
<p>
stiff canvas coat<br>
boots stamped with salted snow<br>
hands cramped around her phone<br>
</p>
<h3>b</h3> <h4>[dmin]</h4>
<em>Behold the heart of empire!</em>
<h3>a</h3> <h4>[Fmaj]</h4>
<p>
black dagger heels in her<br>
mother's old bag<br>
she'll win any inch to have<br>
more than her poor mother had<br>
</p>
<h3>b'<h3> <h4>dmin</h4>
<h2>B</h2> <h4>Bmaj</h4>
<p>
underneath this city<br>
of monuments and marble<br>
inside a crowded carriage<br>
waiting waiting to escape<br>
</p>
<h2>A</h2> <h3>a</h3> <h4>[Fmaj]</h4>
<p>
straight she stands<br>
hair grazing past her neck<br>
wrought flat by hot iron<br>
a beast made tame by fire<br>
</p>
<h3>b</h3> <h4>[dmin]</h4>
<em>watch her play the city girl</em>
<h3>a</h3> <h4>[Fmaj]</h4>
<p>
but her ruse is no use<br>
locks already curling back<br>
tan strands obey no command<br>
singed smell of reprimand<br>
</p>
<h3>b</h3> <h4>[dmin]</h4>
<h2>B</h2> <h4>[Bmaj]</h4>
<p>
this town that takes you over<br>
reflections in the water<br>
an obelisk no greater than a<br>
sword that cuts you down<br>
</p>
<h2>A</h2> <h3>c</h3> <h4>[Fmaj]</h4>
<p>
this old place<br>
I've known my whole life<br>
a marble charade<br>
for common fools<br>
<br>
but what of this girl<br>
before me right now<br>
she would come to this hell<br>
to play make believe<br>
<br>
Goddamn this old place<br>
where I once was so young<br>
that these towers of Rome<br>
seemed so innocent<br>
<br>
Standing here now<br>
in the pit of it all<br>
will I ever return<br>
will this town still be my home?<br>
</p>
<h1>II</h1> <h4>[F#maj]</h4>
snowball fighting<br>
biking in the street<br>
metro riding<br>
when the fare is cheap<br>
<br>
blazing on the mall<br>
scared of the police<br>
DC December<br>
<h1>:||</h1>
<hr>
<h1>I</h1>
<h2>A</h2> <h3>a</h3> <h4>[Fmaj]</h4>
open the door<br>
let this rancid air loose<br>
this place is a trap<br>
let me out! let me out!<br>
<h3>b</h3> <h4>[dmin]</h4>
<h3>a</h3> <h4>[Fmaj]</h4>
this weak minded tool<br>
coming into my town<br>
this brownnosing upstart<br>
a louse! she's a louse!<br>
<h3>b</h3> <h4>[dmin]</h4>
<h2>B</h2> <h4>[Bbmaj</h4>
so much for happy endings<br>
this realm shall go to ruin<br>
this empire be fuled by<br>
the black blood of these clowns<br>
<h2>A</h2> <h3>c</h3> <h4>[Bmaj]</h4>
all this hate<br>
when did it begin<br>
this venom within me<br>
deteriorates<br>
<br>
this, my soul<br>
that good I once had<br>
the boy that I was<br>

once, all I knew was the Red Line
it was only one stop to reach Andrei.s house
but it seemed like a lot to pay the fare price
and the bus was a cheaper way of getting around

Twinbrook is where most of my boys lived
and it's where a lot of them can still be found
We used to kick it after highschool
Rockville used to seem like a pretty big town

*************************------

eventually I figured out Bethesda
where the rich kids blew their money after school
I might've gone  there to take a girl out
but I much preferred kickin with my own crew

soon enough I was in the city
bunch of young kids hitting up U Street
ten dollar show at the Black Cat
legally blazed but too young to drink

Rockville Station
Pedestrian bridge
DC Suburbs
lovely place to live

Winter waking up before the sunrise
just to take that train an hour into Downtown
half these motherfuckers hate their whole lives
the the other half tryna get a piece of that crown
