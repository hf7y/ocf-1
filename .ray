
A while back I was asked this question: “Tell the story of your first kiss. Tell it as a story. No minimalism up in here.” So I did that. It just took me awhile. Names have not been changed at all because I don’t care about people. And if you know something about this story that I left out or was flat-out wrong about, hit me up. I probably would have posted this story, or at least parts of it, quite a while ago, but I never felt comfortable until now. I think the statute of limitations is up on this saga.
The kiss was on May 19, 2010 in the front seat of Titembe, just down the street from my house, but I guess I have to start at the beginning. This story is not complete without the backstory. And there is a ton of backstory. I’m going to pour way too much of my life story into this response but I feel like it’s a cool story (when ended at the right point) and only a small handful of the people I know have any idea about this story, so if you choose to read this long-ass post I hope you enjoy it.  If you don’t like backstory I put a marker where you can start reading and get an abbreviated version. I don’t recommend this option, however.
 June 2005 is the beginning. Mrs. Wessel’s sixth grade social studies classroom at North Bethesda Middle School. I don’t really remember what it was, a nice gesture of some sort, some prolonged eye contact, or perhaps I just misinterpreted friendliness as flirting like I always do, but there was a spark. There was something. So at the age of 10 I had my first crush on one [xxx] [xxx].
Now sixth grade me and now me are very different. If I am a butterfly, sixth grade me was a caterpillar. No, scratch that, a pupa.  (Butterflies have larvae and pupae, right? Been so long since I learned any of this and I am not inclined to look that up for the sake of a metaphor.) I had just moved from a tiny town in Oregon just a year prior, not to mention I was at least a year younger than most of my peers. I also had self-esteem issues thanks to some of the very fine people at North Bethesda Middle School, and sixth grade me is not someone college freshman me would want to spend any time with. I was obnoxious, I cried too much, and  I was not an apt conversationalist in the least.
So, thankfully, I didn’t try to make a move in sixth grade, or that next year in seventh grade. I had my opportunities, but I chose to not act on it because I honestly didn’t have the nerve to actually act on my feelings. (That’s something I didn’t get until 8th Grade Formal, which is a story unto itself. Not nearly as fun as this one.) The summer after seventh grade I moved a few miles away and switched schools, and didn’t bother making much of an effort to keep in touch with anyone from NB, including [xxx]. I still thought about her occasionally, but I sort of thought I would never see her again so I bided my time elsewhere. 
But if the story ended here it would not be the story of my first kiss, now would it? But it does not. I arrive at my high school for orientation on a dreary August day and who do I see talking to Tejas on the steps outside of the auditorium? [xxx]! My high school had a magnet program and she got in it so there she was. So I awkwardly say hi like my awkward self, still kinda in shock about the whole thing (and the whole starting high school thing, obviously). I went into the auditorium and we didn’t see each other much for the rest of the day, or for most of the rest of that semester for matter.
But one way or another, she wandered back in to my life. And for the second time, I felt that same spark. This time, however, somehow emboldened by the events surrounding the 8th Grade Formal incident and armed with a key tool I didn’t have before, friends, I decided to actually try to do something. So my friend Zach and I left our normal lunch spot, an alcove near an elevator in the basement affectionately known as The Cave, and ventured on so-called “Crusades” to “Constantinople,” where [xxx] ate lunch. 
We talked a for a while, and before I knew it we had become pretty good friends again. But the motif of my lack-of-ballsiness rears its head again and I couldn’t really come to my nerves to actually ask her on a date. So Zach, the legendary wingman he is, hatched a genius plan: We would ask her sister to give us a ride down to Bethesda to see a movie, a foreign film called “The Band’s Visit” about an Egyptian brass band (attempting to) playing a concert in a confusingly-named Israeli town, and somehow or another she would end up going with us. By the grace of God or something, that actually ended up working! Yay! Go Zach! We had a good time and I felt like things were moving in the right direction. 
So fast forward a bit. I think we have done the whole mixed CD exchange bit somewhere in here, but really not much of not happens for a few weeks. Late April sometimes, there’s a band concert that [xxx] is performing in as a member of jazz band. Zach goes with me (he owed me one for the two chorus concerts I wingmanned him at) and after the jazz band portion of the concert, [xxx] leaves with her friend Ope to a Gym Class Heroes concert (Remember, this was 2008. They were the shit.) Zach and I leave because, I mean, come on, why would we stay?  [xxx] and Ope see Zach and I leave and we talk for a bit before both us and them leave. 
Sometime between that evening and that next morning, one of them had a realization. The jig was up, if you will. That next morning, in the back of M. Giblin’s French class, Ope, never one to be shy about weighty issues, asked me pretty directly if I like [xxx]. Never one for lying, I responded in the affirmative and waited for the other shoe to drop. 
At the end of this frantic, nerve-wracking day, I got the news I wanted to hear from Zach: According to Ope, these feelings were reciprocated. Needless to say, I was pretty ecstatic. I had to figure out my next move and Zach and I settled on this. After the AP Gov exam on May 5, we would see a movie. After said movie, I would ask her to be my girlfriend and everything would be perfect woooo yayyyy. So the plan was set into motion (if I remember correctly, we were supposed to go to the movies as a group and then there was some strategic bailing on the part of everyone else). I made a key purchase the day before: A tub of sidewalk chalk from the CVS in RTC. Took a few pieces, stashed the rest behind a dumpster just in case. 
After the exam, we made our merry way from RM up to Regal to go see “Iron Man.” We watched it and then walked up to Fleet Street (sorry if you’re reading this and don’t know Rockville well, I assume the asker is from RM but if you’re not, apologies.) where I waited with her while she waited for the 47 bus to take her home. It was a pretty spring day, a bit breezy. I pull the chalk out of my pocket while we’re waiting and we play Hangman on the sidewalk, I let her go first, she plays “rhythm” (clever, right? no vowels besides y) and then it’s my turn. I put down lots of lines and end it with a question mark. She starts playing letters and the words begin to fill in, until after a while she realizes what the words were going to say: “Will you go out with me?”
Instead of the scene that I had in my head playing out next—lots of excited jumping, emotional hugging, maybe even the end of this story—I instead received a rejection. But it wasn’t a blatant no, nothing harsh. It also wasn’t overly patronizing and it seemed 100% authentic. It seemed like it was meticulously planned and extremely well-crafted. It was a rejection so perfect that it took me a walk home and a conversation with my friends Allie and Hana, who I ran into on my way home, to realize it was even a rejection. If I were told today something like I was told then I’d probably be upset; 17-year-old me would prefer the sharper option. But this soft setting down of my feelings was perfect for my young soul. It wasn’t a shot to the heart of my ambitions, just a little poison in an IV drip.
After the rejection, she played one more word (“helicopter”) before catching the bus back home, and I began my contemplative walk home. [xxx] messaged me on Facebook later that evening, reiterating what she had said back on Fleet Street, basically saying that she really wanted to just be friends at the moment and wouldn’t rule out something down the road. 
Over the next few years, I tried to move on. I was marginally successful in turning my longing gaze elsewhere, but she still lingered in the back of my mind. I treated that Facebook message the way Supreme Court Justices treat the Constitution, applying events and moments to it and waiting for the perfect time to strike again.
One event that helped with this process of moving on was the Homecoming dance in October of my sophomore year. I went by myself, just hoping to hang out with friends, and hey maybe getting a chance to dance with [xxx]. But, for whatever reason, I never got a chance. The facts here are fuzzy, but at the time I felt like she was actively avoiding making eye contact with me. Even though this was really demoralizing, it was probably for the better because that led to me not trying much of anything for the next year or so, saving me from heartbreak and allowing for something to happen to the future.
Time to fast forward again. We’re now in the spring of my junior year and by this time I had gone back to being close friends with [xxx], along with the aforementioned Allie and Hana. My sights, however, were turned elsewhere as I was still wary of putting that friendship in any sort of jeopardy. One of my “crushes” was a girl who I was pretty sure liked me but I wasn’t sure if I liked her enough to take the plunge. Another was an averted disaster: I was certain she liked me but that just wasn’t the case in the least. And another was a girl who I felt pretty strongly about but who I think was just a tad out of my league. 
But thanks to one Jonathan Frankle, I began to consider [xxx] again. Jonathan Frankle is interesting character; I’m not going to take the time to go into it however. He came up to me one day during a drama rehearsal (I was on sound crew, she was in the pit orchestra, Frankle was assistant director?) and tells me that he heard from someone somehow that she had a thing for me. At first I was excited, but of course, after what happened freshman year, I’d become very hesitant of second-hand information. Still, I began to try to hang out with her a bit more. Prom season passed without asking any of the three aforementioned people or [xxx], instead seeing me ask someone else (in what is a very confusing episode of my personal history, one I will spare going into) and get rejected. 
Hanging out with [xxx] more, studying and watching movies and playing games and just shooting the shit with her and Hana and Allie made me start to see that Frankle might have not been steering me wrong. One car ride in particular, when [xxx] drove me back in her red two-door named Titembe from an Enviro study sesh at Hana’s house, really just felt right. I felt that it was finally the time that was prophesized over two years prior. Another major factor was Allie’s strong prodding of me to ask her out, despite not telling me what she thought of what [xxx] would say, meaning that [xxx] told her she liked me and Allie was bound by woman code not to tell me anything but at the same time wanted to see us happen. 
So I make the decision to go for it. I finally have the confidence to forget the woes of freshman year and try to reach the goal I’d been striving after for half a decade. 
So this story finally reaches the foretold date, May 19, 2010. It was a Friday, a bit warmer than it was May 5, 2008. My Intro to Film Studies class was taking a field trip to the Regal Theatres that Friday, and Mrs. Malone so graciously allowed us to bring guests. I invite [xxx] along and during the second part of the school day we go to Town Center to see “Iron Man 2.” (Note this film compared to the film we watched two years prior). After the movie the two of us and our friend Charlotte hit up Noodles and Company for some lunch. We ate outside and had some very nice conversation. Charlotte leaves and [xxx] and I hop in Titembe. 
I was then a member of the Rockville Recreation and Parks Advisory Board, and at the previous meeting, one of the members sang the praises of the then-brand new College Gardens Park. Complete with pond, fountain, and nice decks, I thought it would be a rather romantic place to go about asking her out. 
But it was not. The vegetation along the pond was still pretty disgusting, and the pond itself was a muddy, mucky, unattractive mess. We played on the playground for a bit but I think we came to an unspoken consensus that this is not where we wanted this to happen. So we do what we had done and enjoyed before: visit a record store. We drove down the Pike to the CD store above the Hertz in Woodmont Station shopping center (it’s like next to Ledo’s and across from Best Buy and McDonald’s and whatnot, for those of you not privy to names of shopping centers on Rockville Pike) and browse a bit. I don’t think either of us made purchases; the place was a bit pricey.
The anticipation was just too much for me. I’d been bottling this up inside for the last two hours; Heck, I’d been bottling this up inside of me for the last two years. So in the shopping center parking lot, I began to form the words. To my surprise, I get interrupted and [xxx] shuffles me back to the short staircase connecting the parking lot to the strip with the CD store and pulls out of a folded piece of paper. “It’s my turn,” she says as I unfold the paper to reveal a crossword puzzle. It doesn’t take me long to realize that the clues led to the words “Will you go out with me?”
The emotion in that moment is something I’d never really felt before or since. It was just incredible the way it all played out, the fact that she felt as strongly as I did. This fantastic feeling filled me in a way it had never had before. 
After a short talk and hug sesh, we get back in the car and head towards RM to watch part of a charity soccer tournament. The windows were down, the skies were clear, and “Tik Tok” was playing on the radio. I felt almost on top of the world at that moment. At the tournament we see Ope and Allie and Hana and they are just as happy as we are. [xxx] and I leave there around 6 or 6:30, and she gives me a ride back to my house.
But unexpectedly she stops a few houses short. Instead of being in front of 1017, my house, we were in front of 1007, a house with a tall hedge and a rather creepy house. More importantly, out of sight of my house. “I want to kiss you,” she said confidently. I obviously wasn’t taken aback by the proposal, but I was certainly surprised. Was it really supposed to go this fast? This was my first relationship, and previously I haven’t really had anything that even remotely resembled a two-way interpersonal romantic encounter, so I really didn’t know want to think. She makes sure I’m OK with it, and, naturally I agree. 
Kissing isn’t one of those things taught at school. And though some people apparently learn how to do it at camps, I went to a chess camp for most of my early adolescence, so I really had no clue what I was doing. She went in for it and it lands, but I don’t really do much in return. My lips just kind of stayed there, not really allowing for much expression of emotion. It was a bit awkward, so we decide to try again. A little better, but I’m pretty sure those were my two worst and two best kisses of my life. Technically they were awful, but the magic of a first kiss, no matter how awkward, is hard to top. Especially with back story like this. 
And thus ends my story. She drives up past 1009, 1013, 1015, and drops me off in front of my house and then drives away.
This obviously isn’t the very end of the story. More events unfold, of course. But that is not what you asked for and I don’t know if I’m ready to publish to the internet any of that.
To the asker: I don’t know why you are curious as to this aspect of my romantic history, or any aspect for that matter, but I hope you found my response sufficient. With a word count of 3,141 , there’s no minimalism up in here.
Again, if I screwed anything up, let me know.
And remember, kids: Patience is a virtue.
