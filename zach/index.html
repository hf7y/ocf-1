	<div id="berkeleyside">
		
one o one
driving on
way past sausolito
nausea in a rental car

admiring 
some rich f's farm
with a valley view
care of the sierra club

where the water 
pulls the skin tight 
up against your bones

and the chinese freighters
disappear into the smoke

that's where we are

a million years
this battered stone
met the malice of the
desperate north pacific ocean

it lost its ground
but it kept its soul
a wounded heart
beating on a battered coast

if it could talk it'd let you know

I want you way out of my town
and don't you go to san francisco either
all you fuckers on the west coast
can't you leave me alone

just let the ocean break my bones
and grind them into mud and dust
the wind can turn my blood to rust

then turn me back
to berkeleyside
dump me with the street kids
while you go and live my life

they'll smoke me out
they'll stay the night
huddled up
I'll find myself a place to die
		
	</div>
	<div id="freiburg">
		
in the freiburg forest
witnessing the old world trees
lose the first of their leaves

company of dappled light
dancing on a listing stream

welcome autumnn arbourrouge dismantling
holy autumn arbourrouge dismantling

the freiburg forest
sifting porous paraply
making time to make peace
		
	</div>
	<div id="gun">
		
I could've chewed you out
line by line and each one numbered
and it would leave no doubt
but it's just fine to keep you wondering

I'm sure you'll come up with it
but keep it to yourself
I'm alright without you burning my cool

back on that beautiful coast
hearing the white of the ocean
muscle the earth to its bones

release with the lapping of the sea
chiseling the canvast coast
cut into relief
	
but patiently
the monster knocks with a fist full of rocks

salt water knuckling the earth til it buckles
the dirt and the grit and the stone
slipping slowly under

along the coast I wander with a star in the west
seawrack sparkling sea smelling green
sunset firework leathering my chest

cerise the color of the eve
night for the ripe day decadent and sweet
cherry kissed by the lips of the sea
horizon hologram swallowed by the beast

on my mind I wish you'd get off of it
wish I could think about
black pacific ocean without seeing you
		
	</div>
	<div id="whitman">
		
when the lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed
I had that guitar that I stole from you
and as our star stole west I sang the blues

I didn't have no electric bass
no drum machine no cassette tape
I just sang that blues til it went away

o warbling bird sing your song from the swamp
o grey brown bird sing at death of him I love

I saw you last on that berkeley roof
as the sun beat down til the sky was bruised
when the lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed
		
	</div>
	<div id="boulder">
			
I've seen the alps
I drank a wheat beer up there with adolf and his pals
I took a look at that anschluss view 
and I still don't get what that war is all about

and I've been to boulder
I seen those big old rocks hanging over my head
and if those colorado boys still want me dead
I don't know but I wish they'd get it over with

I'm taking the high road
I'm getting up and over it
it's gonna take more than geography
to keep me from keeping on
		
O appalachia
you done sublimated through the ages
you don't stick way out up into the clouds
but your hills are wise
	they're just the right size for me
