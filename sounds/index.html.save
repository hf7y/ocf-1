B

cold December morning
deep beneath the city
electrocuted voice announcing:
capitol south: doors opening left side


A

a

stiff canvas coat
boots stamped with salted snow
hands cramped around her phone

b

Behold the heart of empire!

a

new leather shoes in her
mother's old bag
she'll win any inch
to have more than her poor mother had

B

underneath this city
of monuments and marble
inside a crowded carriage
waiting waiting to escape

A

a

straight she stands
hair grazing past her neck
wrought flat by hot iron
a beast made tame by fire

b

watch her play the city girl

a

but her ruse is no use
locks already curling back
??????
??????

B

a town that takes you over
reflections in the water
an obelisk no greater than a
sword that cuts you down

A

c

this old place
I've known my whole life
a marble charade
for common fools

but what of this girl
before me right now
she would come to this hell
to play make believe

Goddamn this old place
where I once was so young
that these towers of Rome
seemed so innocent
